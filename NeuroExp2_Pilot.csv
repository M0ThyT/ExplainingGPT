0,2,With,True,"[1]-I choose explanation 1 because it provides a plausible explanation for the gender difference in spatial reasoning. The fact that men had played more sports in their childhood on average than the women could have led to differences in brain development in the right premotor area, which is known to be involved in spatial tasks."
0,1,Without,False,[2]-I chose explanation 2 because it seems more plausible that the subjects missed seeing the second house because they were still processing the first house and did not have enough attentional resources left.
0,2,With,True,"[1]-I choose explanation 1 because it provides a clear and plausible explanation for the gender difference in spatial reasoning. The fact that men had more sports involvement in their childhood could have led to better development of the right premotor area, which is involved in spatial tasks."
0,1,Mixed,True,"[2]-I chose explanation 2 because it provides a more specific and detailed explanation of the phenomenon, citing the involvement of the frontal lobe areas in mediating attention and the temporal relationship between the two houses as the cause of the attentional blink."
0,1,With,True,[2]-I chose explanation 2 because it provides a clear reason for why the attentional blink occurs. The temporal relationship between the two houses is a logical explanation for why subjects failed to press the button for the second house.
0,0,Without,True,[1]-I chose explanation 1 because it seems more logical that the babies were surprised by the unexpected outcome of seeing only one doll instead of two. It also aligns with the idea that babies have some understanding of basic arithmetic.
0,1,Mixed,True,[2]-I chose explanation 2 because it provides a more specific and scientific explanation for the phenomenon. It mentions the role of frontal lobe areas in mediating attention and how the temporal relationship between the two houses caused the attentional blink.
0,1,Mixed,True,[2]-I chose explanation 2 because it provides a more specific and scientific explanation for the phenomenon. The explanation that the frontal lobe areas mediate attention and the temporal relationship between the two houses caused the attentional blink makes more sense to me than the explanation that the subjects did not have enough attentional resources left.
0,2,With,True,"[1]-I chose explanation 1 because it provides a clear and logical explanation for the gender difference in spatial reasoning. The fact that men played more sports in their childhood on average could have led to more development in the right premotor area of the brain, which is known to be involved in spatial tasks. Therefore, this explanation seems more plausible to me."
0,1,Without,True,"[1]-I chose explanation 1 because it makes sense that if the subjects were still processing the first house, they would not have enough attentional resources left to process the second house."
0,2,With,True,"[1]-I choose explanation 1 because it provides a plausible explanation for the gender difference in spatial reasoning. The fact that men played more sports in their childhood on average could have led to better development of the right premotor area, which is involved in spatial tasks."
0,2,Without,True,"[1]-I chose explanation 1 because it provides a plausible explanation for the gender difference in spatial reasoning abilities. The fact that men had played more sports in their childhood on average than women could have contributed to the development of their spatial reasoning abilities. Explanation 2, on the other hand, seems to blame women for their poor performance without considering other factors that could have influenced their abilities."
0,0,Without,True,"[1]-I chose explanation 1 because it seems more plausible that the babies were surprised by the unexpected outcome of only one doll being on the stage, rather than simply preferring the display with one doll."
0,0,Without,True,[1]-I chose explanation 1 because it seems more logical that the babies were surprised by the unexpected outcome of seeing only one doll instead of two. It makes sense that they would look longer to try to understand what happened.
0,0,Mixed,True,[1]-I chose explanation 1 because it seems more plausible that the babies were surprised by the unexpected outcome of seeing only one doll instead of two. It makes sense that they would look longer to try to understand what happened. The second explanation seems too technical and doesn't explain why the babies would look longer at the stage.
0,1,With,True,"[2]-I chose explanation 2 because it explains that the attentional blink occurs due to the temporal relationship between the two houses. The second house appeared too soon after the first one, so the subjects were still processing the first house and missed the second one."
0,1,With,True,"[2]-I chose explanation 2 because it explains that the attentional blink occurs due to the temporal relationship between the two houses. The second house appears too quickly after the first one, which causes the subjects to miss it."
0,0,Without,True,"[1]-I chose explanation 1 because it seems more logical that the babies were surprised by the unexpected outcome of seeing only one doll instead of two, which led them to look longer. It makes sense that the babies had an expectation of how many dolls there should be on the stage."
0,1,With,False,"[2]-I chose this explanation because it seems to make more sense that the subjects simply didn't have enough attentional resources to process the second house, rather than the temporal relationship between the two houses causing the attentional blink."
0,1,Mixed,True,[2]-I chose explanation 2 because it provides a more specific and detailed explanation for the phenomenon. The explanation mentions the role of frontal lobe areas in mediating attention and how the timing of the appearance of the two houses causes the attentional blink.
0,2,With,False,[2]-I choose explanation 2 because it provides a plausible explanation for the gender difference in spatial reasoning. The fact that men had played more sports in their childhood on average than the women suggests that the difference in sports involvement could have contributed to the gender difference in spatial reasoning. Brain scans indicating the involvement of the right premotor area in spatial tasks support this explanation.
0,1,Without,False,[2]-I chose explanation 2 because it seems more plausible that the subjects missed seeing the second house because they were still processing the first house and did not have enough attentional resources left. This explanation takes into account the limited capacity of attentional resources and how they can be exhausted by processing the first house.
0,2,Mixed,True,"[1]-I chose explanation 1 because it provides a clear and plausible explanation for the gender difference in spatial reasoning abilities. The fact that men had played more sports in their childhood on average than women could have contributed to the difference in spatial reasoning abilities. On the other hand, explanation 2 seems to be based on a single brain area and does not account for other factors that could have contributed to the gender difference."
0,0,Mixed,False,"[2]-I chose explanation 2 because it seems more plausible that the babies were surprised by the unexpected outcome of seeing only one doll instead of two, which led to their prolonged looking time. It makes sense that they had an expectation of how many dolls there should be and were surprised when that expectation was not met."

0,2,With,False,[2]-I choose explanation 2 because it provides a clear reason for the gender difference in spatial reasoning ability. The fact that men had played more sports in their childhood on average than the women provides a plausible explanation for why they performed better on the spatial reasoning tasks.
0,1,With,False,[2]-I chose explanation 2 because it makes more sense to me that the subjects were still processing the first house and didn't have enough attentional resources to process the second one.
0,2,Mixed,True,"[1]-I chose explanation 1 because it provides a clear and plausible explanation for the gender difference in spatial reasoning abilities. The fact that men had played more sports in their childhood on average than the women suggests that the difference in involvement in sports could have contributed to the difference in spatial reasoning abilities.

0,1,Without,False,"[2]-I chose explanation 2 because it seems more plausible that the subjects were unable to process the second house due to a lack of attentional resources, rather than the temporal relationship between the two houses causing the attentional blink."
0,1,With,True,"[2]-I chose explanation 2 because it explains that the attentional blink occurs due to the temporal relationship between the two houses. The second house appears too soon after the first, which causes the subjects to miss it."
