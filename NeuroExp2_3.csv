It also seems more reasonable than the explanation that women's poor performance in the right premotor area is the sole reason for the gender difference.
0,2,Without,True,[1]-I chose explanation 1 because it provides a plausible explanation for the gender difference in spatial reasoning abilities. The fact that men had played more sports in their childhood on average than women could have contributed to the difference in spatial reasoning abilities. Explanation 2 seems to be biased and does not take into account other factors that could have contributed to the gender difference.
0,0,With,False,"[2]-I chose explanation 2 because it makes more sense to me that the babies were surprised by the unexpected number of dolls, rather than having a preference for the display."
0,1,With,False,[2]-I chose explanation 2 because it seems more plausible that the subjects missed the second house because they were still processing the first one and didn't have enough attentional resources.
0,2,Mixed,True,[1]-I choose explanation 1 because it provides a clear explanation for the gender difference in spatial reasoning abilities. The fact that men had played more sports in their childhood on average than the women suggests that the difference in involvement in sports explains the gender difference in spatial reasoning abilities.
0,2,With,True,"[1]-I chose explanation 1 because it provides a clear and logical explanation for the gender difference in spatial reasoning. The fact that men had more sports involvement in their childhood and that this is associated with better spatial reasoning is a plausible explanation. Explanation 2, on the other hand, seems to suggest that women are inherently worse at spatial reasoning, which is not supported by the evidence presented."
0,1,Without,False,"[2]-I chose explanation 2 because it makes sense that if the subjects were still processing the first house, they would not have enough attentional resources left to notice the second house."
0,2,With,False,[2]-I choose explanation 2 because it provides a more plausible explanation for the gender difference in spatial reasoning. The fact that men had played more sports in their childhood on average than women is a more convincing explanation for the difference in spatial reasoning ability than the brain scans of the right premotor area.
0,2,Mixed,False,[2]-I choose explanation 2 because it provides a clear and plausible reason for the gender difference in spatial reasoning abilities. The fact that men had played more sports in their childhood on average than the women is a logical explanation for why they performed better on the spatial reasoning tasks. The explanation is also supported by the data collected from the interviews.
0,2,Without,False,[2]-I choose explanation 2 because it provides a plausible explanation for the gender difference in spatial reasoning abilities. The fact that men had played more sports in their childhood on average than the women suggests that the difference in involvement in sports could have contributed to the gender difference in spatial reasoning abilities.
0,1,Without,False,[2]-I chose explanation 2 because it seems more plausible that the subjects missed seeing the second house because they were still processing the first house and did not have enough attentional resources left.
