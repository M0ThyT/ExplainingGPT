The babies saw a hand reach out and place one doll on the stage. Then a screen was raised, hiding the doll. A hand reached out again and placed a second doll on the stage, out of sight behind the screen. Then the screen dropped. In some cases, there were two dolls on the stage, as there should be, and in some cases there was only one doll. The researchers found that the babies looked much longer at the stage when there was only one doll than when there were two dolls. This looking-time difference between one doll and two dolls lead the researchers to conclude that babies can calculate 1 + 1 = 2.', \n",

Subjects had to press a button each time they saw a house. When the two houses were far apart in the sequence, the subjects were very good at this task. But when the houses were presented close together in the sequence, subjects failed to press the button for the second house. The researchers call this phenomenon “attentional blink.”', \n",
