The fact that men had played more sports in their childhood on average than the women is a plausible explanation for why they performed better on the spatial reasoning tasks. The brain scans only show that the right premotor area is involved in spatial tasks, but they do not provide a direct explanation for the gender difference."
0,0,Mixed,False,"[2]-I choose explanation 2 because it seems more plausible that the babies were surprised by the unexpected outcome of seeing only one doll, which caused them to look longer. It makes sense that they had an expectation of how many dolls there should be and were surprised when that expectation was not met."
0,1,Without,True,"[1]-I chose explanation 1 because it makes sense that if the subjects were still processing the first house, they would not have enough attentional resources left to process the second house."
0,1,Mixed,False,"[2]-Explanation 2 seems more satisfying to me. The explanation that subjects missed seeing the second house because they did not have enough attentional resources left seems more plausible to me. It makes sense that the brain needs time to process the first house and that this processing takes up attentional resources, which then leads to the attentional blink."
0,2,With,False,[2]-I chose explanation 2 because it provides a clear and plausible explanation for the observed gender difference in spatial reasoning. The fact that men had played more sports in their childhood on average than women is a reasonable explanation for why they performed better on spatial tasks.
0,0,Without,False,"[2]-I chose explanation 2 because it seems more plausible that the babies were surprised by seeing only one doll on the stage, which led to their longer looking time. It makes sense that they had an expectation of seeing two dolls and were surprised when that expectation was not met."

0,2,With,False,[2]-I choose explanation 2 because it provides a clear reason for the gender difference in spatial reasoning. The fact that men had more sports involvement in their childhood on average could have contributed to their better performance in spatial tasks. The brain scans also support this explanation.
0,0,Without,True,[1]-I chose explanation 1 because it seems more logical that the babies were surprised by the unexpected outcome of seeing only one doll instead of two. It makes sense that they would look longer at the stage to try to understand what happened.
0,0,Mixed,True,[1]-I chose explanation 1 because it seems more plausible that the babies were surprised by the unexpected outcome of seeing only one doll instead of two. It makes sense that they would look longer at the stage to try to understand what happened. The brain scan explanation in explanation 2 seems less convincing to me.
0,2,Without,False,"[2]-I chose explanation 2 because it provides a more plausible explanation for the gender difference in spatial reasoning abilities. It suggests that the gender difference is not due to inherent differences in cognitive abilities between men and women, but rather due to differences in experiences and opportunities."
0,2,Mixed,True,"[1]-I chose explanation 1 because it provides a clear and plausible explanation for the gender difference in spatial reasoning abilities. The fact that men had played more sports in their childhood on average than the women suggests that the difference in involvement in sports could have contributed to the gender difference in spatial reasoning abilities. On the other hand, explanation 2 seems less convincing as it only focuses on the brain scans of the right premotor area and does not take into account other factors that could have contributed to the gender difference."
0,2,Mixed,True,"[1]-I choose explanation 1 because it provides a clear explanation for the gender difference in spatial reasoning abilities. The fact that men had played more sports in their childhood on average than the women is a plausible explanation for the difference in spatial reasoning abilities. On the other hand, explanation 2 seems to be a bit far-fetched as it is based on brain scans and does not take into account other factors that could contribute to the gender difference."
0,1,With,False,"[2]-I chose explanation 2 because it explains that the attentional blink occurs due to the lack of attentional resources. The first explanation only mentions the temporal relationship between the two houses, but it doesn't explain why the second house is missed."
0,0,With,False,"[2]-I chose this explanation because it makes more sense that the babies were surprised to see only one doll instead of two, which led them to look longer. It seems more plausible than the idea that they were doing math calculations in their heads."
0,1,Without,False,[2]-I chose explanation 2 because it seems more plausible that the subjects missed seeing the second house because they were still processing the first house and did not have enough attentional resources left.
0,2,With,False,"[2]-I choose explanation 2 because it provides a clear and plausible reason for the gender difference in spatial reasoning. The fact that men had played more sports in their childhood on average than the women is a logical explanation for why they performed better on the spatial reasoning tasks. The brain scans simply confirm that the right premotor area is involved in spatial tasks, but do not provide a direct explanation for the gender difference."
0,0,With,True,"[1]-I chose explanation 1 because it provides a clear and logical reason for why the babies looked longer when there was only one doll on the stage. The idea that the parietal lobe, which is involved in math, governs the babies' expectations about how many dolls there should be makes sense and is supported by brain scans."
0,1,Mixed,True,"[2]-I chose explanation 2 because it provides a more specific and detailed explanation of the phenomenon. The explanation mentions the frontal lobe areas, which have been previously shown to mediate attention, and how the temporal relationship between the two houses caused the attentional blink."
0,0,Mixed,False,"[2]-I chose explanation 2 because it seems more plausible that the babies were surprised by the unexpected outcome of seeing only one doll instead of two, rather than having a fully developed understanding of addition."
0,0,Without,False,"[2]-I chose this explanation because it makes more sense to me that the babies were surprised by seeing only one doll instead of two, which led to them looking longer. It seems more logical than the idea that the babies' looking time was directly proportional to how much they liked the display."
0,2,Mixed,True,"[1]-I chose explanation 1 because it provides a clear and plausible explanation for the observed gender difference in spatial reasoning abilities. It suggests that the difference in involvement in sports during childhood could have contributed to the difference in spatial reasoning abilities between men and women. On the other hand, explanation 2 seems to be more speculative and does not provide a clear link between brain scans and spatial reasoning abilities."
0,2,Without,True,"[1]-I chose explanation 1 because it provides a plausible explanation for the gender difference in spatial reasoning abilities. It suggests that the difference is not due to innate differences between men and women, but rather due to differences in childhood experiences."
0,0,Mixed,False,"[2]-I choose explanation 2 because it seems more plausible that the babies were surprised by the unexpected outcome of seeing only one doll instead of two, which led to their increased attention. It also aligns with what we know about how humans learn and form expectations based on previous experiences."
0,0,With,False,"[2]-I chose explanation 2 because it makes more sense that the babies were surprised by seeing only one doll instead of two, which led them to look longer. The idea that the babies were calculating 1+1=2 seems unlikely given their age and cognitive abilities."
